# Unimodal trapezoid fuzzy sets

This library implements the basic functionality of trapezoidal fuzzy intervals.
Implements support for basic operations:
- Fuzzy set addition
- Subtraction of fuzzy sets
- Division of fuzzy sets
- Multiplication of fuzzy sets
- Exponentiation
- Fuzzy set completion
- Finding it mean
- Finding his variance
- Supremum
- Infimum
- Equality / inequality of sets

The library also allows you to:
- Find the length of a set
- Round borders
- Check if the element is contained in the set (1, if the probability is not = 0)
- Check the probability of finding an element in a set
- Display set

## Fuzzy field
- The library also you to:
- Add multiple sets to a field
- Show all sets in the field
- Clear field
- Fold fields
